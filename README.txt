Porting OpenWebRTX to Python3.

I did this because the project got discontinued, and it requires Python 2 which is old and does not get any security patches since its deprecated as of January 2020.

All code in this repo released under its respective license.

*I do not own this code, it is just a fork of it for it to support Python 3 and improve it.*
